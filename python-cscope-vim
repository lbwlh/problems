Tip for vim users,
(all you gui ppl hush!)

* Install cscope

* Stick this in your ~/.bashrc:
alias pyscopeupd='find "$PWD/" -name "*.py" -o -iname "*.cfg" > \
     cscope.files && cscope -bv -i cscope.files -f cscope.out'

* Download this into your ~/.vimrc:
http://cscope.sourceforge.net/cscope_maps.vim

* After updating your local repo. branch, run the 'pyscopeupd' alias to
build/update cscope databases.

* Edit some python as normal with vim.

* Found a variable/function call you forgot about?  Stick your cursor on
it, type ctrl+[space] then 's'.

* Pick a selection from the list, and it'll open the reference in a vim
window.  (ctrl-w + w to switch windows, ctrl-w + c to close window).
